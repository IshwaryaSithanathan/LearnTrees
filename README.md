# Data-Tree-Visualisation

This is a learning application for datastructures and algorithms.
Currently it only provides the visualisation for the data trees which are bst, avl, and rb trees.

The executable jar and exe files are provided in the "out/artifacts" folder.

Great thanks to @Daniel Liang for the easy explanatations.
